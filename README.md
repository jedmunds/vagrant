Vagrant?
=======

Vagrant is a 'wrapper' for many different virtual machine providers, in other words, it is a single solution to spin up virtual machines from the command line with programs like virtualbox, or cloud-based services like amazon's EC2 or VMWare's vSphere. Easily bootstrap and provision machines with a single command! Please, developers, make your life easy. Check it out! http://vagrantup.com. 

Welcome to a new way of using vagrant, flexible and fully parameterized.

<h2>Vagrantfile</h2>
This file would normally be auto-generated by Vagrant, but with some heavy-duty ruby lifting, this Vagrantfile has been fully abstracted to an external file called shelters.yaml. Anything you need, from a default box to provisioner settings to AWS account information has been coded into this vagrant file and is used in an as-needed logical way. Feel free to poke around, please comment or contribute.

<h2>shelters.yaml</h2>
This is the file you should primarily be editing. You no longer need to edit the Vagrantfile directly. (And I suggest you do not unless you really know what you are doing, you may get unexpected results). Below I've outlined the basic settings you will need to configure:
aws_access_key_id: your AWS access key id, you can find this in your AWS settings.
aws_ami: The amazon linux AMI you want to use.
aws_keypair_name: You will need to generate a keypair with AWS and then name it. That you put here.
aws_private_key_path: I suggest placing this in the current directory.
aws_secret_access_key: Found in the AWS settings right under the access key id.
aws_security_groups: If you are using security groups in EC2, this will be the group you are using.
box: The default box you want to use for bringing up virtual machines. (find some at vagrantbox.es)
box_url: The URL of your default box.
private_key_path: the path to the private key you are using (if any) for vagrant.

<h2>Vagrant Installation Instructions</h2>

<h3>Mac Users:</h3>
Note: The ruby version Macs ship with will NOT work with the vagrant-aws plugin, I strongly recommend following the 
instructions below.<br/>
<ol>
<li>Install VirtualBox: <a href="http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/4.2.14/VirtualBox-4.2.14-86644-OSX.dmg">VirtualBox-4.2.14.dmg</a><br/></li>
<li>Install <a href="http://developer.apple.com/downloads">Command Line Tools for Xcode</a>, you will need your Apple ID.<br/></li>
<li>Install git <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/mac">Git for Mac</a><br/></li>
<li>Install RVM for installing Ruby (backslash included):<br/>
<code>\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash</code><br/></li>
<li>Configure RVM for use:<br/>
<code>source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm</code><br/></li>
<li>Install ruby:<br/>
<code>rvm install 1.9.3</code><br/></li>
<li>Install <a href="http://files.vagrantup.com/packages/7e400d00a3c5a0fdf2809c8b5001a035415a607b/Vagrant-1.2.2.dmg">Vagrant-1.2.2.dmg</a><br/></li>
<li>Install vagrant-aws plugin:<br/>
<code>vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws</code><br/></li>
<li>Clone my vagrant_shelters repo:<br/>
<code>git clone https://github.com/jedmunds/vagrant/</code></li>
<li>cd into the directory:<br/>
<code>cd vagrant_shelters</code><br/></li>
<li>Edit the shelters.yaml file to include your local paths rather than mine.<br/></li>
<li>Run vagrant up environment, where environment is a name in the shelters.yaml file or a custom VM name. For instance:<br/>
<code>vagrant up confluence</code><br/></li>
<li>If you want to bring up machines with AWS, append --provider=aws to your 'vagrant someCommand someEnvironment' commands, and it should just 'work'.<br/>
<code>vagrant up confluence --provider=aws</code><br/></li>
</ol>

<h3>Windows Users:</h3>

<h4>Windows Debugging</h4>
<h5>'Vagrant up' yields an error, and won't get very far at all.</h5>
<p>This is probably due to a bad virtualbox version, did you install the SPECIFIC version vagrant needs? 4.2.12</p>
<h5>'It looks like it's working, but it hangs for a long time at "Waiting for VM to boot. This can take a few minutes. . ."</h5>
<p>Shake your first at windows for having such a crappy system clock, and fix yours.<br/>
Control Panel > System > Date and Time > Internet Time > Change Settings > srbsldc > Update now.<br/>
This could also be because you don't have the proper private key for your vagrant machine, in which case you will<br/>
need to Ctrl-C and then manually run 'vagrant ssh'</p>
<h5>Vagrant tells me I don't have an ssh client installed! Help!</h5>
<p>99% chance this is because you changed the install directory of MinGW. If you changed it to something other than C:\MinGW\, probably C:\Program Files\MinGW, you will have to manually add the binaries in there to your Windows path. I strongly recommend you uninstall it and reinstall it in C:\MinGW\ If that is not the issue, try to use the 'ssh' command from cmd.exe. If that does not work, you did something horribly wrong with the MinGW installation.</p>


<h2>FAQ</h2>

<strong>Will the Vagrantfile work by itself?</strong>
No, with such heavy parameterization the Vagrantfile needs the shelters.yaml file to work (at all)

<strong>What's with all the weird-looking code in your Vagrantfile?</strong>
Vagrantfiles are written in ruby, and all the weird-looking code is just 'extra' ruby.

<strong>Why should I use your Vagrantfile? I'll just write my own!</strong>
Please do! Playing with vagrant is fun, and I don't intend to deprive anyone of the opportunity. However, for those that want a working, cross-platform, scalable solution, I suggest at least skimming over my Vagrantfile.
